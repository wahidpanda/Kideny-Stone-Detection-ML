The identification of kidney stones using several imaging modalities is proposed. a deep learning-based automated approach for identifying kidney stones. An open-source dataset of computed tomography (CT) images is used in the studies. These datasets have been designed to function with deep learning models. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping is used to identify the kidney stone's location. Email me at islamoahidul12@gmail.com for the data set.
